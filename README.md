Accounts Cleaner
======

Accounts Cleaner is an application for BlackBerry10 devices running a minimum of 10.3.1 OS.
It allows you to view, update and delete accounts on your device by an external provider.

##View
A harmless action with no consequences whatsoever.

##Update
An action that removes the "require password update" flag from the account and doesn't change any of the accounts data in any other way.
This will resolve random appearing notifications in Hub.

##Delete
A highly dangerous and volatile action. Use this action if you are absolutely sure that no harm will be done. If you are unclear than do not use it.
It will delete the account from your device permanently. There is no undo or going back after this.
If used without caution, bad things might happen, in range from application reinstallation or even OS recovery.

#Use this application at your own risk.
#None of the authors, contributors, administrators, vandals, or anyone else connected with this application, in any way whatsoever, can be held responsible for your use of the application.
